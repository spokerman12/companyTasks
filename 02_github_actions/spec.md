2. GitHub Actions Self-Hosted Runners
Background
We are looking to enhance our CI/CD capabilities and provide our engineering teams with
more flexible and simple solutions. We want to implement self-hosted runners in AWS to
encourage wider adoption of GitHub Actions and ensure they align with our Golden Paths for
development. This will allow our teams to leverage the benefits of GitHub Actions while
maintaining control over their build environments.
Solution
Develop a solution for implementing and managing GitHub self-hosted runners in AWS. The
solution should include:
● Develop the required Github Actions workflows, including jobs for building, testing
and deployment.
● Develop the required Terraform code to automate the provisioning of self-hosted
runners in AWS for the source code project.
Deliverable
● Provide IaC templates for provisioning self-hosted runners in AWS
● Provide clear and concise documentation on how to deploy, configure, and manage
the self-hosted runner solution.
● Present your solution, highlighting the key features, design choices, and benefits.
You may present your solution in a GitHub repository.
