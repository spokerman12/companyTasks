A Terraform module will be created to automate the provisioning of S3 buckets within AWS.
This module will handle bucket creation, configuration of settings (e.g., versioning and
encryption), and management of access policies.
To simplify the Terraform interactions for developers, a straightforward interface (e.g., web
form, CLI tool, or API endpoint) will be implemented. Through this interface, developers will
provide the required information, including:
● Bucket Name
● Target AWS Account (e.g., staging or production)
● Desired Bucket Settings (e.g., versioning and encryption)
The tool will then use the Terraform module to create the S3 bucket according to the
specified configuration in the designated AWS account.
Deliverable
● A document detailing the technical implementation plan for automating the creation of
S3 buckets in specified AWS accounts.
● Include a step-by-step breakdown of the process, necessary tools and technologies,
security considerations, and any potential challenges.
